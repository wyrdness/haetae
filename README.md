# Haetae (해태)

## Overview
The Haetae (also spelled Haechi or Haetae) is a legendary lion-like guardian creature from Korean mythology that serves as a powerful symbol of justice, law, and protection. This mythical beast possesses the ability to distinguish between good and evil, judge the guilty from the innocent, and protect against fire and natural disasters. Most famously, stone statues of Haetae guard the gates of Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, and the creature has become an official symbol of Seoul itself, representing the city's commitment to justice and safety. The Haetae embodies fundamental Korean values of righteousness, moral judgment, and divine protection against chaos.
